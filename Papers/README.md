Brown, N. (2024a). "The Cognitive Type Project - Mapping Typography to Cognition" https://github.com/nikbearbrown/CognitiveType/tree/main/Papers/The_Cognitive_Type_Project_Mapping_Typography_to_Cognition
The Cognitive Type Project aims to develop computational tools for crafting typefaces with various cognitive properties, benefiting fields such as advertising, education, and dyslexia support. This paper delves into the intricacies of computational tools and cognitive science, detailing how datasets and models linking typography with cognition are created to understand how type design influences reading comprehension and aesthetic perception. Techniques like lexical databases, generative models, and foundational models inspired by AI systems are employed to facilitate the creation of open-source text-to-type models.

Brown, N. (2024b). "The Abecedarian Classification of Type" https://github.com/nikbearbrown/CognitiveType/tree/main/Papers/The_Abecedarian_Classification_of_Type 
"Abecedarian Axes of Variation" introduces a comprehensive type classification system that integrates attributes from multiple established typographic classification systems into a unified framework focused on training machine learning models. Abecedarian enables machine learning models to understand and generate typefaces with unprecedented accuracy and specificity, potentially revolutionizing how designers interact with type libraries and automate typeface design. 

Brown, N. (2024c). "The Abecedarian Visual Typographic Lexicon" https://github.com/nikbearbrown/CognitiveType/tree/main/Papers/The_Abecedarian_Visual_Typographic_Lexicon
"Abecedarian: A Visual Typographic Lexicon" introduces a novel typographic classification system aimed at training deep learning models. By amalgamating attributes from established typographic classifications, the system facilitates the creation of fonts with specific cognitive properties, revolutionizing font design and ensuring designs are historically informed and cognitively effective, thereby envisioning an intelligent future for typographic selection.
