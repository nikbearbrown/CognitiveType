# The Cognitive Type Project - Mapping Typography to Cognition

The Cognitive Type Project is focused on developing computational tools to enable the design of typefaces with varying cognitive properties. This initiative aims to empower typographers to craft fonts that enhance click-through rates for online ads, improve reading levels in children's books, enable dyslexics to create personalized type, or provide insights into customer reactions to textual content in media. A significant challenge in research related to mapping typography to cognition is the creation of thousands of typefaces with minor variations, a process that is both labor-intensive and requires the expertise of skilled typographers. Cognitive science research highlights that the design and form of letters, along with the text's overall layout, are crucial in determining the ease of reading and other cognitive properties of type such as perceived beauty and memorability. These factors affect not only the legibility and clarity of information presentation but also the likability of a typeface.

Our research is committed to generating publicly available datasets and establishing foundational models that link the detailed anatomy of type with eye-tracking data from individuals interacting with text. By enriching existing datasets with insights into the physical and cognitive impacts of typefaces, we strive to illuminate the role of typography in reading comprehension and aesthetic appreciation. To this end, we are taking several approaches for easily creating cognitive type, that is, type that can be assessed for cognition. We have developed a lexical database mapping thousands of typographic terms to representational images. We use languages like Metafont and tools like Variable Fonts to create cognitively relevant glyphs. We use generative models to generate type and understand the typographic latent space.

Finally, we are constructing a foundational model, inspired by AI systems like Midjourney and DALLÂ·E, to facilitate the creation of an open-source text-to-type model. This model will enable typographers or researchers to specify the visual characteristics of a font, such as serif type, x-height, or bowl shape, translating the complex terminology of typeface classification into clear images for integration into typography software like FontForge or use in cognitive studies.
